## Introduction

My partner and I went on a very brief, but fun overnight adventure to Eureka Springs this weekend.

## Eureka!

WMy partner and I went on a way too quick trip up to Eureka Springs to stay the night at a place called Waterloo Lodge. The pictures of the place made it look fun and cozy. Plus, they allow pets, so that's a cool thing. 

So, we packed up and brought our dog Alfie with us and he made quite a few friends. It's nice being able to bring him with us now that he's older and doesn't jump as much. 

Not pictured is the massive plate of nachos we enjoyed, but we did enjoy our time. Here's a few photos from that adventure.

## Reflection/Conclusion

I learned that it's hard staying awake after 10pm and we should bring travel pillows with us. Womp Womp. 

Until Next Time,
Charles
