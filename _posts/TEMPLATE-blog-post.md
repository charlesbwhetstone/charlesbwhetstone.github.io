## Image Usage Guide

**Inline Images (Recommended):**
- Basic: `![Alt text](/assets/images/filename.jpg)`
- With caption: Add `*Caption text*` on the line below
- Custom sizing: Use HTML `<img>` tag with style attributes

**Image Dimensions for Inline Use:**
- **Full width**: 800-1200px wide (scales automatically)
- **Medium size**: 600-800px wide (good for most content)
- **Small/thumbnail**: 300-500px wide
- **Height**: Maintain original aspect ratio (auto-scaling)

**Image Tips:**
- Place all images in `/assets/images/` folder
- Use descriptive filenames: `2025-09-21-project-screenshot.jpg`
- Optimize images for web (keep file sizes under 1MB)
- Always include alt text for accessibility
- JPG for photos, PNG for screenshots/graphics with transparency
