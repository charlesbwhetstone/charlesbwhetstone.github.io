Howdy,  

I’ve been wanting a spot to post more casual updates, share what I’m building, and drop in some random life things along the way. This’ll be that place.

## What to Expect

Nothing too formal here. Think of it as a mix of:

- **Projects**: little behind-the-scenes peeks at what I’m working on  
- **Tech Stuff**: thoughts on AI, data, and whatever new tools I’m testing  
- **Life Things**: music, records, tattoos, family moments, and random adventures  
- **Games**: updates on *Electric Crust Pizza Delivery* and other experiments

## Electric Crust Pizza Delivery

Quick update on the [Electric Crust Pizza Delivery game](/pizza-game/): I’m honestly so happy with how it turned out. What started as a goofy side idea from a case study became one of my favorite creative projects.  

The game has:  
- Space pizza delivery chaos  
- Power-ups and different enemies  
- A high score board with local saves  
- Works on mobile with touch controls  
- Retro arcade vibes (with modern code under the hood)

Confession: I still can’t break into the top 10 on my own leaderboard. If you beat my score, let me know — I need the motivation.  

## What’s Next?

Always tinkering, always building. A few things on my radar:  
- More data science / forensic engineering projects  
- New interactive experiments  
- Some AI and machine learning deep dives  
- Maybe some music + vinyl talk for fun

Appreciate you stopping by — and if anything here sparks your interest, don’t be shy about reaching out.

Best, 
Viper
