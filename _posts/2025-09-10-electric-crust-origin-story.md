excerpt: "How a fictional company from a data analysis project became an electrifying space pizza delivery game. I fell into the (space) gap."

## From Case Study to Space Adventure

It all started with a data analysis project I was working on - an employee attrition case study for a fictional company called "Electric Crust." As I was adding this project to this website, my mind went down a random path like it can sometimes to video games.

## The "What If" Moment

Then I had one of those random creative moments: *What if Electric Crust wasn't just a regular pizza company, but a futuristic space-based pizza delivery service?* 

That silly thought wouldn't leave my head, and before I knew it, I was sketching out game concepts during coffee breaks.

## Building It Out

The technical challenge was a, well, challenge. I wanted to build something with:
- Mobile touch controls
- A proper retro arcade feel
- Local high score persistence
- A fun experience

## The Fun Details

Some of my favorite features that made it into the game:
- **Power-ups with visual effects** - The shield creates a hexagonal barrier around your ship
- **Enemy variety** - From basic invaders to heavy tanks to speedy scouts
- **Pizza bullet projectiles** - Because of course you shoot pizzas in a pizza delivery game
- **Screen shake and particle effects** - For that satisfying arcade feedback

## Lessons Learned

Space Pizza is hard.

## Try It Yourself

If you haven't played it yet, [give Electric Crust Pizza Delivery a try](/pizza-game/)! And if you beat my high score, I'll be both impressed and slightly embarrassed.

What started as a random creative tangent from a data project has become one of my favorite portfolio pieces. Sometimes the best projects come from the most unexpected places.

*Next up: I'm thinking about adding more levels and maybe some boss battles. If you have any suggestions, let me know!*
