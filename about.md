I'm a Forensic Engineer with an expertise in eDiscovery. In my work life, I enjoy transforming complex data into actionable insights that span across the ever evolving landscape of machine learning, predictive analytics, and analysis. I'm quite fascinated with the use of Artificial Intelligence and it can enhance my professional and personal life. 

In my human life, I love spending time with my awesome family, collecting records and tattoos, watching film, and playing music. I've always had a knack for figuring out how things work and this is a glimpse into that world.
