I'm a Forensic Engineer with an expertise in eDiscovery. In my work life, I enjoy transforming complex data into actionable insights that span across the ever evolving landscape of machine learning, predictive analytics, and analysis. I'm quite fascinated with the use of Artificial Intelligence and it can enhance my professional and personal life. 

In my human life, I love spending time with my amazing family, collecting records, tattoos, watching film, and playing music. I've always had a knack for figuring out how things work and this is a glimpse into that world.

Another hobby I've recently picked up is creating interactive experiences such as building out an endless runner arcade game for this website. This game is inspired by an attrition related case study for a fictional company called Electric Crust, which can be seen in my Projects page. 

[Electric Crust Pizza Delivery game](/pizza-game/) is a space based adventure delivering pizzas and avoiding alients and other hazardous objects in space. Check it out and let me know what you think. I haven't been able to crack the top 10 in scoring yet, but maybe you can.
