# Music and Beyond

Welcome to my musical world and creative endeavors beyond data science.

## The Boom Bang

The Boom Bang will always have a special place in my heart. This was a garage/punk/noise band I had with my buddies. We always loved hanging out with each other and goofing around. That led to several years of music. This endeavor has led to lifelong memories and friends for life. We are in the slow works of putting some new songs together. Stay tuned for this and new merch.
