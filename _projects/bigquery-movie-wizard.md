## Project Overview

The Movie Wizard is an intelligent movie recommendation system built for a BigQuery AI hackathon, leveraging advanced AI embeddings and vector search capabilities.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses machine learning embeddings for accurate movie suggestions
- **Vector Search**: Advanced similarity search using vector databases
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on Google BigQuery for handling large datasets
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast recommendation generation for users

## Technologies Used

- **BigQuery**: For data storage and processing
- **AI Embeddings**: For semantic understanding of movie content
- **Vector Search**: For finding similar movies efficiently
- **SQL**: For complex data queries and analysis
- **Python**: For data processing and model integration

## Architecture

The system processes movie data through multiple stages:
1. Data ingestion and preprocessing
2. Embedding generation for movie features
3. Vector database creation and indexing
4. Real-time recommendation serving

## Results

Successfully created a scalable movie recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions based on user preferences and movie characteristics.
