excerpt: "This project is a privacy-first, on-device journaling assistant. It combines Speech-to-Text transcription (Whisper, Faster-Whisper, or Vosk), text analysis with Gemma 3n via Unsloth, emotion-aware journaling (voice, text, and images), and an offline-first design so no data leaves the device."
